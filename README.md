## üìñ Overview

**soenneker.quark.components.cancellable** offers a straightforward way to manage cancellations in your applications. It provides a basic class that allows each component to have its own CancellationTokenSource. This helps you keep your program responsive by allowing you to stop operations when needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

To run **soenneker.quark.components.cancellable**, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later
- .NET Version: .NET Core 3.1 or higher
- Space: At least 50 MB free on your drive

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This library allows you to use cancellation tokens in your components. Each component you create can have its own cancellation token. This means you can manage tasks more effectively and keep your application responsive, especially during long-running tasks.

### üìö Key Features

- **Per-Component Cancellation**: Each of your components can manage its own cancellation without affecting others.
- **Easy Integration**: Integrate with your existing projects with minimal effort.
- **Simple API**: Use basic commands to set up and handle cancellations.

## üñ•Ô∏è Using the Library

After installation, you can include **soenneker.quark.components.cancellable** in your projects. Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to set it up:

1. Create a component in your project.
2. Include the library using `using Soenneker.Quark.Components.Cancellable;`
3. Initialize the CancellationTokenSource within your component. 

Here is a basic code snippet for reference:

```csharp
public class MyCancellableComponent
{
    private CancellationTokenSource _cancellationTokenSource;

    public MyCancellableComponent()
    {
        _cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
    }

    public void CancelOperation()
    {
        _cancellationTokenSource.Cancel();
    }
}
```

This initializes a cancellation token source and gives you a method to cancel ongoing operations.

## ‚ö° Examples of Use Cases

1. **Form Submission**: If a user submits a form and the submission process takes a while, you can cancel it if they change their mind.
2. **Data Fetching**: When your application fetches data from an API, allow users to cancel the request if the data takes too long to load.
3. **Background Tasks**: For long-running background tasks, provide users the control to stop the process at any time.

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

- **Check Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required .NET version installed.
- **Review Error Messages**: Take note of any error messages for a quick solution.
- **Community Support**: Explore discussions and issues on the [Issues Page](https://github.com/bageraor/soenneker.quark.components.cancellable/issues).
